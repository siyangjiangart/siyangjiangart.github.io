                        <p>Hello, I'm Siyang Jiang, a digital artist passionate about exploring the boundaries between technology and creativity. My art emerges from the intersection of the digital and physical worlds, aiming to capture the essence of our hyperconnected era.</p>
                        
                        <p>With a background in visual arts and a deep fascination for new technologies, my work spans from interactive installations to augmented reality pieces. I strive to create immersive experiences that challenge the viewer's perception and invite reflection on our relationship with the digital world.</p>
                        
                        <p>Over the years, I have exhibited my work in numerous international galleries and digital art festivals, receiving recognition for innovation and originality. In addition to my exhibitions, I have also contributed to the film industry by creating stunning After Effects for various films. My expertise extends to both CG art and VFX, as well as motion design.</p>
                        
                        <p>Recently, I have been exploring the techniques of CGAI (Computer-Generated Artificial Intelligence) and AI, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in digital art. This new direction allows me to blend traditional digital art practices with cutting-edge AI technologies, creating unique and thought-provoking pieces.</p>
                        
                        <p>When I'm not in my digital studio, I dedicate my time to teaching, sharing my passion for digital art with the next generation of creatives. I firmly believe in the power of art to inspire, provoke, and transform our understanding of the world around us.</p>

                            <h4>Look at</h4>
                            <p>This work features a virtual eye, modeled and rendered, displayed on a screen. The eye blinks and moves around the surrounding space at the normal speed of a human eye. Notably, this eye possesses no defined identity, being entirely created through computer processing. When encountering this cyclically blinking eye while observing the artwork, ambiguous and profound reflections emerge. The act of the eye closing becomes both a natural symbol and one devoid of identity. This symbol, stripped of any identifying connotations, challenges our most common daily behavior: visual contact with others. It seems to embody the deepest meaning of observing such behavior: what are we really observing at any given moment? Or, from what perspective are we being observed?</p>

                            <h4>Sign, The fourth scene</h4>
                            <p>This CG short film, spanning just over two minutes, presents the artist's 3D reinterpretation of Bentham's Panopticon. The camera journey begins inside a dark, damp cell on the first floor, gliding outward through cold, rusted iron bars. It then transitions to a display screen—a symbol of millennial digital culture that starkly contrasts with Bentham's era. Flickering on the screen is a poem by Novalis, exploring the eruption of human emotions triggered by a simple symbol, a fleeting flash.</p>

                            <p>Ascending, the camera peers through a second-floor peephole into the Panopticon's central observation room. This space, vastly different from the grim cells below, features a flickering crystal chandelier at its heart. Our perspective becomes engulfed by this chandelier and the surrounding crimson symbols of power. Suddenly, after a burst of white light, a pale pink rose blossoms on the third-floor observation deck. Its vitality transcends time as surrounding vegetation swiftly overtakes the entire Panopticon. Overhead, a metallic object twists and spirals, forming an uncanny shape under light that resembles sunlight yet feels distinctly artificial.</p>

                            <p>This piece is an artistic exploration of the Panopticon, an early prison design, capturing the shift in perspective from the lower prison levels to the third-floor observation room and lookout tower. It conveys a sense of totality, where light and surroundings change to reflect the evolving positions and perceptions of the self. On the first level, the scene is bathed in dim, moon-like light, with damp surfaces and moss reflecting this faint glow. Novalis' poetry resonates with a deep sense of melancholy.</p>

                            <p>As the camera moves to the second level, a transformation takes place, marked by an intense red that symbolizes a shift in status. The room is suffused with a vivid, almost blood-like red, and the sculptures become more tangible. The golden patterns on the central table and the rich redwood texture assert a powerful sense of desire—desires that are as blinding as the white light that follows.</p>

                            <p>After this burst of white light, everything becomes purified, as pure as nature itself, mirroring the raw suffering of the lower levels. The plants here defy conventional definitions; they can only be described as "beautiful." The sculptures, once grounded, are now overturned, transformed into floating, suspended objects that reflect intense light in all directions. These objects have no fixed shape; their fluidity becomes part of their essence. In this space, thought and form merge, creating an environment that transcends the physical and enters the realm of the mind.</p>

                            <p>This work aims to give the audience more space for interpretation and let the piece speak for itself. It's more of a sensory experience than a vehicle for theory or explanation. Like the shifting perspectives within the piece, it transcends the boundaries of subjective and objective. Each space the perspective passes through has its own unique qualities, free from any constraints.</p>

                            <h4>Error</h4>
                            <p>La frase "cogliere il punto" ci porta dritti al significato, all'evocazione, di quest'opera. L'intuizione dell'Artista è potente, ai limiti del clamoroso e utilizza un alfabeto semplificato, come una freccia che attraversa l'aria per andare nel centro del paglione colorato del bersaglio. L'abile uso dello sfuocato precipita in una sola, piccola porzione dove tutto accade nella meraviglia dell'infinitesimo perfetto, a fuoco. Preciso. Una seconda abilità è nel comporre un'immagine dove il centro non è geometricamente posizionato nel mezzo, il centro non è una soluzione architettonica... è un'alchimia di dimensioni, colori, verità, del tutto inattesa. E proprio questo cambio di paradigma il presagio più felice. Un presagio davvero, l'espressione di un elegante spirito dell'opera. - Andrea Ciresola</p>
                            
                            <p>This artistic creation, born from the intricate interplay of multiple 3D modeling software, delves deep into the exploration of observer subjectivity. The video features a faceless female figure obscured behind frosted glass, her eyes momentarily unveiled through subtle shifts in perspective and variations in light. This mysterious figure, whose identity remains concealed, symbolizes the elusive nature of our perceptions. At the same time, she evokes a timeless ideal of beauty, resonating with iconic masterpieces like Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and traditional depictions of the Madonna. The observer is left in a state of ambiguity, with their judgment clouded by the fluidity of the images and the shifting light. The title of the work underscores this uncertainty: everything that has happened and everything yet to come could unravel as a mere illusion, a deli</p>
