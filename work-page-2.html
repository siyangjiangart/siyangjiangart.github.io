                    <h4>Look at</h4>
                    <p>This work features a virtual eye, modeled and rendered, displayed on a screen. The eye blinks and moves around the surrounding space at the normal speed of a human eye. Notably, this eye possesses no defined identity, being entirely created through computer processing. When encountering this cyclically blinking eye while observing the artwork, ambiguous and profound reflections emerge. The act of the eye closing becomes both a natural symbol and one devoid of identity. This symbol, stripped of any identifying connotations, challenges our most common daily behavior: visual contact with others. It seems to embody the deepest meaning of observing such behavior: what are we really observing at any given moment? Or, from what perspective are we being observed?</p>
