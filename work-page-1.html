                <h4>Sign, The fourth scene</h4>
                <p>This CG short film, spanning just over two minutes, presents the artist's 3D reinterpretation of Bentham's Panopticon. The camera journey begins inside a dark, damp cell on the first floor, gliding outward through cold, rusted iron bars. It then transitions to a display screen—a symbol of millennial digital culture that starkly contrasts with Bentham's era. Flickering on the screen is a poem by Novalis, exploring the eruption of human emotions triggered by a simple symbol, a fleeting flash.</p>

                <p>Ascending, the camera peers through a second-floor peephole into the Panopticon's central observation room. This space, vastly different from the grim cells below, features a flickering crystal chandelier at its heart. Our perspective becomes engulfed by this chandelier and the surrounding crimson symbols of power. Suddenly, after a burst of white light, a pale pink rose blossoms on the third-floor observation deck. Its vitality transcends time as surrounding vegetation swiftly overtakes the entire Panopticon. Overhead, a metallic object twists and spirals, forming an uncanny shape under light that resembles sunlight yet feels distinctly artificial.</p>

                <p>This piece is an artistic exploration of the Panopticon, an early prison design, capturing the shift in perspective from the lower prison levels to the third-floor observation room and lookout tower. It conveys a sense of totality, where light and surroundings change to reflect the evolving positions and perceptions of the self. On the first level, the scene is bathed in dim, moon-like light, with damp surfaces and moss reflecting this faint glow. Novalis' poetry resonates with a deep sense of melancholy.</p>

                <p>As the camera moves to the second level, a transformation takes place, marked by an intense red that symbolizes a shift in status. The room is suffused with a vivid, almost blood-like red, and the sculptures become more tangible. The golden patterns on the central table and the rich redwood texture assert a powerful sense of desire—desires that are as blinding as the white light that follows.</p>

                <p>After this burst of white light, everything becomes purified, as pure as nature itself, mirroring the raw suffering of the lower levels. The plants here defy conventional definitions; they can only be described as "beautiful." The sculptures, once grounded, are now overturned, transformed into floating, suspended objects that reflect intense light in all directions. These objects have no fixed shape; their fluidity becomes part of their essence. In this space, thought and form merge, creating an environment that transcends the physical and enters the realm of the mind.</p>

                <p>This work aims to give the audience more space for interpretation and let the piece speak for itself. It's more of a sensory experience than a vehicle for theory or explanation. Like the shifting perspectives within the piece, it transcends the boundaries of subjective and objective. Each space the perspective passes through has its own unique qualities, free from any constraints.</p>

                <h4>floor plan and 3D model of the Panopticon</h4>
                <p>This is the floor plan and 3D model of the Panopticon, created in AutoCAD, based mainly on the research and ideas of Jeremy Bentham. Due to its complexity and specific challenges, this building was never fully constructed. However, many buildings and prisons throughout history bear similarities to it. The goal of this project is to virtually construct this unfinished architectural concept, allowing viewers to experience the restoration of the original meaning of the structure through CGI art, with some aesthetic elements incorporated.</p>
