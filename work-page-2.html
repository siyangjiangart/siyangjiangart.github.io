                    <h4>Look at</h4>
                    <p>This work features a virtual eye, modeled and rendered, displayed on a screen. The eye blinks and moves around the surrounding space at the normal speed of a human eye. Notably, this eye possesses no defined identity, being entirely created through computer processing. When encountering this cyclically blinking eye while observing the artwork, ambiguous and profound reflections emerge. The act of the eye closing becomes both a natural symbol and one devoid of identity. This symbol, stripped of any identifying connotations, challenges our most common daily behavior: visual contact with others. It seems to embody the deepest meaning of observing such behavior: what are we really observing at any given moment? Or, from what perspective are we being observed?</p>

                        <h4>Maya 3D Production Workflow</h4>
                        <p>This video demonstrates the complete Maya 3D production pipeline:

                        1. Modeling: Creating the base 3D mesh and detailed geometry
                        2. UV Unwrapping: Preparing the model's surface for texturing
                        3. Material Development: Applying and adjusting materials and textures
                        4. XGen Hair/Fur System: Implementing realistic hair and fur effects
                        5. Rigging: Setting up the skeletal structure for animation
                        6. Animation: Creating character movement and expressions
                        7. Weight Painting: Fine-tuning the skin binding for smooth deformation

                        Each step showcases the technical expertise required in professional 3D character creation, from initial concept to final animation.</p>
